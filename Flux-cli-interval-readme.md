Let's break down and explain the intervals in the different FluxCD YAML files to understand what they mean and how they interact with each other. Here’s an explanation for each of the files:
```bash
flux get kustomizations -A

NAMESPACE       NAME            REVISION                                SUSPENDED       READY   MESSAGE
flux-system     flux-system     flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:1ea78270        False           True    Applied revision: flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:1ea78270
flux-system     podinfo-default flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:b39f49d3        False           True    Applied revision: flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:b39f49d3
flux-system     podinfo-prod    flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:b39f49d3        False           True    Applied revision: flux-k8s-multi-env@sha1:b39f49d3

### 1. **GitRepository for Flux-System (`gotk-sync.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: flux-system
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
```

- **`interval: 1m0s`**: This defines how often Flux will check for changes in the Git repository for the `flux-system` source.
  - **What it means**: Flux will check the GitHub repository every **1 minute** to see if there are any new changes in the branch or the repository. This is especially relevant for the Flux system itself, where frequent updates or configuration changes might occur.
  - **Why it's used**: Since Flux is managing the GitOps synchronization, you want it to pick up changes quickly and reconcile the `flux-system` resources. Therefore, a 1-minute interval is suitable for high-frequency changes.

### 2. **Kustomization for `podinfo-default` (`podinfo-default-kustomisation.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: podinfo-default
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m0s
  path: ../../kustomize/overlays/default
```

- **`interval: 5m0s`**: This defines how often Flux will reconcile (apply) changes for the `podinfo-default` Kustomization.
  - **What it means**: Flux will check and apply the Kustomization for the `podinfo-default` resource every **5 minutes**. It means Flux will check if the `kustomize/overlays/default` path in your Git repository has any changes every 5 minutes and will apply the necessary updates to your Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Why it's used**: This is generally used for deployment configurations, where changes might be less frequent than for the Git repository itself. An interval of 5 minutes allows Flux to apply updates in a more moderate, controlled manner, ensuring that Kubernetes is kept in sync with your repository without frequent overhead.

### 3. **GitRepository for `podinfo` (`podinfo-repo.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1m0s
```

- **`interval: 1m0s`**: This defines how often Flux will check for changes in the `podinfo` repository (the source repository that holds the actual resources, such as deployments and services).
  - **What it means**: Flux will check the `podinfo` Git repository every **1 minute** for updates (new commits, changes, etc.).
  - **Why it's used**: This allows Flux to quickly react to any updates in the `podinfo` repository, ensuring that the Kubernetes resources defined within it are kept up to date with the latest version of the repository.

---

### **Summary of the `interval` Values**

- **`flux-system` GitRepository (`gotk-sync.yaml`)**: Flux checks for updates every **1 minute**. This ensures that Flux's core resources (e.g., its own configuration and setup) are updated quickly.
  
- **`podinfo` GitRepository (`podinfo-repo.yaml`)**: Flux checks for updates every **1 minute**. This ensures that the `podinfo` repository, which may contain the application deployment manifests, is synchronized frequently with the cluster.

- **`podinfo-default` Kustomization (`podinfo-default-kustomisation.yaml`)**: Flux checks for updates every **5 minutes**. This defines the frequency with which Flux reconciles the resources defined in the `podinfo-default` Kustomization. Since this is a deployment configuration, a slightly longer interval (5 minutes) is used to ensure resources are reconciled at regular intervals, but without the constant overhead of checking every minute.

---

### **Why Use Different Intervals for Each File?**

1. **Git Repositories (1-minute interval)**: The `flux-system` and `podinfo` Git repositories are being monitored frequently (every minute) because they likely represent essential configuration or core application resources that may be updated frequently, and you want them synchronized quickly with your Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Kustomization (5-minute interval)**: The `podinfo-default` Kustomization is checked less frequently (every 5 minutes) because it represents the application-specific configurations, which might not change as often as the Git repository itself. By reducing the frequency of reconciliation, you can save on compute resources while still ensuring regular synchronization.

---

### **What Happens When Code is Pushed to GitHub?**

1. **Push Code to GitHub (flux-system repository)**: If you push code to the `flux-system` repository, Flux will check it within **1 minute** (because the interval is set to `1m0s`). Any changes to Flux-related configurations will be quickly reflected in the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Push Code to GitHub (podinfo repository)**: If you push code to the `podinfo` repository, Flux will check for changes within **1 minute** and synchronize any changes in the `podinfo` application resources to the Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Kustomization**: For the `podinfo-default` Kustomization, Flux will reconcile the resources in your cluster based on the changes in the Git repository every **5 minutes**. So, even if you push updates, Flux will wait until the next 5-minute interval before applying any changes to the cluster.

### **What If You Want Faster Updates?**

- **Reduce the interval**: If you want Flux to apply changes more quickly, you can reduce the `interval` value (e.g., change `5m0s` to `1m0s`). This will make Flux check for changes and apply them more frequently.
  
- **Ensure synchronization**: If you need more immediate synchronization, especially for deployments, adjusting both the GitRepository and Kustomization intervals to `1m0s` ensures changes are applied as soon as they are detected.

---

### Conclusion:

- **Shorter intervals (1 minute)** are useful when you want Flux to frequently check and apply changes to critical configuration files (like Flux system and core app repositories).
- **Longer intervals (5 minutes)** are appropriate when the resources (like deployments or environment-specific configurations) don’t need to be reconciled as often, reducing unnecessary load on the cluster.

By adjusting the intervals based on your needs, you can ensure Flux operates efficiently and appropriately for your use case.
